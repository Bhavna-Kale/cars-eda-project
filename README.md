## 💡 Project Goal

The used car market is expanding rapidly, yet buyers and sellers often rely on guesswork for pricing. This project aims to provide a **data-driven foundation** for the market by conducting a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of used car listings.

The core objective is to uncover and visualize the key market drivers—such as **age, mileage, engine power, and location**—that most significantly influence a used car's final **Selling Price**.

## ✨ Key Features & Insights

This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical visualization to deliver actionable market intelligence.

* **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Handled missing values, standardized complex text-based columns (`Mileage`, `Engine`, `Power`) into consistent numerical units, and performed **Feature Engineering** to extract `Company_Name` and `Model_Name` from the main car name.
* **Price Drivers Identification:** Visualized correlations to clearly show which car attributes (like manufacturing year and kilometers driven) have the strongest relationship with the selling price.
* **Depreciation Analysis:** Illustrated the typical non-linear depreciation curve of a car's value over its age.
* **Market Segmentation:** Provided regional analysis of average prices and car availability across different cities.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** The entire analysis is hosted on an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard (`app.py`), allowing users to dynamically filter and explore the visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

| Category | Tools & Libraries |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ |
| **Data Processing** | `pandas`, `numpy` |
| **Visualization** | `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, **`altair`** (for interactive charts) |
| **Web Application** | **`Streamlit`** (`app.py`) |
| **Data Files** | `Cars (1).csv`, `Cars_cleaned.csv` |

You are correct. As an AI, I cannot directly create or save a physical file named README.md to your computer or your repository.

However, what I can do is generate the complete text content that you can easily copy and paste into a file named README.md within your project folder.

I have already provided the full content in the previous response, but here it is again in a clean, complete block for easy copying:
